# ImboClientCli - A command line client for Imbo
This is a command line wrapper around the official [ImboClient](https://github.com/christeredvartsen/imboclient-php) client.

## Configuration file
ImboClientCli requires a configuration file located in either `/etc/imboclientcli/config.yml` or `~/.imboclientcli/config.yml`. You may also specify a custom configuration file by using the `--config /path/to/config.yml` global option.

An example configuration file is included in the package.

## Installation
ImboClientCli will be available via pear.starzinger.net once the first package has been released. Until then, (fork and) clone the project and play around with it. This is a WIP and still in a very early phase, so expect things to be broken.

## Usage
Simply run the executable and you will see something like this:

More docs will be added later.
